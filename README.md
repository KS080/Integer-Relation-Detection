# Integer-Relation-Detection
This project delves into symbolic computation, focusing on integer relation detection with the PSLQ algorithm and exploring Julia Sets. It aims to find a new integer relation for Ï€ and analyze fractals' behavior, highlighting the algorithm's utility and fractals' complexity. The goal is practical application and deep mathematical exploration.
