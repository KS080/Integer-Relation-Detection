# Symbolic Computation Project

## Overview
This project focuses on symbolic computation, tackling two key areas: integer relation detection using the PSLQ algorithm and exploring Julia Sets. The aim is to discover a new integer relation for π and to delve into the complexities of fractals through Julia Sets, emphasizing the utility of algorithms and the intriguing nature of fractal behavior.

## Features
- **Integer Relation Detection**: Implements the PSLQ algorithm to find novel integer relations, focusing on π.
- **Julia Sets Exploration**: Offers a platform for experimenting with Julia Sets to understand fractal behavior and their sensitivity to initial conditions.

## Getting Started
